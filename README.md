## Sub-Heading ##
  > Find and share solutions to the problems you encounter while learning to code.

## Summary ##
  > CodeWiki is a community wiki where you can find, rate, and post resources that help you solve all the problems you encounter while learning.

## Problem ##
  > StackOverflow, Slack, Quora, YouTube -- there are countless resources to turn to when you have an issue with your code. But it may take hours to find the one that solves your specific problem, and you may not remember where to find the answers again when you need them. 

## Solution ##
  > CodeWiki is a place to gather your resources and profit from the resources that other code ninjas have posted. Posts are ranked by the community so you can immediately find links that are the most likely to be helpful, and you can see all of your helpful walkthroughs, blog posts, StackOverflow answers, and more in one place.

## Quote from You ##
  > 'Whenever I learn a new programming concept, I rely heavily on the programming community and the solutions they've already found -- why reinvent the wheel? But I'm constantly on separate Google searches and different websites. I built CodeWiki because it's the programming wiki I wanted when I started learning to code.' - Kay, builder

## How to Get Started ##
  > Sign up, sign in, and browse through the resources posts. Upvote the ones you find most helpful, downvote the ones you find confusing. Post resources of your own, and be sure to include a tweet-length description of what problem it helped you solve.
